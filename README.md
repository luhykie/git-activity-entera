## What I Learned About Git and GitHub
I learned that Git is a tool that helps you track and save changes in your project, while GitHub is like a Google Drive for Git projects. It is a website where you can store your files online, share them, and work together with others. Git keeps a record of all the changes you make, and GitHub makes it easy to upload your work, download updates, and collaborate with your team. I also learned basic commands like init, add, and commit for saving changes, and push, pull, and clone for sharing and updating projects on GitHub.
